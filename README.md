# 🌐 Mentor AI Prototype – Frontend

Welcome to the frontend of the **Mentor AI Prototype**, a sleek, lightweight interface for interacting with an AI-powered backend (built on `flan-t5-large` + math fallback).

This site is built for clarity, usability, and easy integration — all hosted on GitHub Pages for public viewing and demo access.

> ✨ Ask questions. Solve math. Explore open-source AI. ✨

## 🖥️ Features

- 💬 Prompt input with natural language or math
- 🤖 Dynamic AI response display
- 🔄 Loading state indicator
- 🎨 Clean dark-mode design with responsive layout

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – semantic structure
- **CSS3** – custom styling
- **JavaScript** – fetch API, input handling
- **GitHub Pages** – hosting & deployment
- **Flan-T5 (via FastAPI backend)** – smart responses

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters a prompt (math or natural language)
2. Frontend sends a `POST` request to your backend (`/generate`)
3. Backend returns:
   - A math result (e.g., `The answer is 144`)
   - Or a language-model response (e.g., `Gravity is a force...`)
4. Response is displayed in the styled output area

## ✨ Final Words

This isn't just a prototype — it's proof that open-source tools, clever design, and a bit of hustle can build something powerful.

No APIs. No GPUs. Just:
- One streamlined AI
- A calculator that never lies
- And a frontend that gets out of your way

If this was built in a week... imagine what comes next. 🚀
